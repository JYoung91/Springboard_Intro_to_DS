This README is to explain my reasoning behind my coding in visualizing the titanic dataset.

The variables included in the dataframe include:

Pclass - defined by 1, 2, 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd class)
Sex - defined by factor levels of 2, 1 (female, male)
Survived - defined by factor levels 0, 1 (FALSE, TRUE)
Age - defined by numeric values

While the example exercise broke down the over arching group by whether or not they survived, I wanted to do so by class to show a similar visualization. It should ideally express the same outcome that:
1. The distribution of passengers are concentrated between the ages 20-40
2. There is a higher proportion of males relative to females
3. More males perished than females regardless of class 
4. The mortality of males passengers in 3rd class was the highest, especially between ages 20-40, where there was the highest frequency of males on the ship.
